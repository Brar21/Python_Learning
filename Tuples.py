#Tuples in python
'''
you can print tuples values.
but you cannot change anything in tuple.
tuples length is pre-defined which never can change
'''

#who you can know that it is tuple or not?
#it can store 4-data types but not like "List"=[]
#you store value as "(1,"yes",1.5,true)" let understand with example

t=("python",True,1,10.10)
print(t)#all values will print
#you can print single value also using slicing
print(t[2])#index number=2 item will print

#Can you chnage values in tuple like you don in "List"
#t[2]=5
#print(t) #now got an error because you read values from tuple but cannot chnage that value.
