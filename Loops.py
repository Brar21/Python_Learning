#Loops is very importent role in coding

inital =0
#while inital>10 :
    #print("yes")  #nothing will happen because "0 can never bigger than 10"
    #but if we reverse the condition "initial<10" than infinity loop will start which never stop
    # to stop that loop on somewhere you have to provide  some case or condition to it
    #like
while inital<10 :
    print("yes" + str(inital))  #now "yes" print 5 time than loop stop becasue after that initial become bigger

    inital=inital+2
