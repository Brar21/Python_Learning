# Python_Learning


## Installation of Python in your System

1. go to website- ```www.python.org``` 
2. click on dowloads select you OS accordingly.
3. Download the latest version.
4. Open download file and follow the steps

# Install VSCode
 
1. go to website- ```www.code.visualstudio.com``` 
2. click on dowloads select you OS accordingly.
3. Download the latest version.
4. Open download file and follow the steps

***Open window.powershell***
   - ```python``` in powershell. then you will enter in python world.
   - ```exit()```  write in powershell you will come out from python.
   - for just check version of Python you installed just type ```python --version``` in powershell.
   - ```pip``` for just create python environment like- install,uninstall Packages. etc.
   - ```pip --version``` for check version and where our "pip" is installed.

# What is pyhton?
  ***Python is programing language which help us to communicate with computer or laptop even with any type of opreating system.
  It is very simple and easy to understand  like reading a simple "English". Python pseudo code nature make python easy to learn for non-codder to just start learning coding and machine learning***

# What is PIP?
  ***Pip is the package maneger for pyhton like Node or npm in package manager for javascript/Node.js.you can use pip to install packages or a module on your system.***

# what are Modules?
  ***Module is a file with code written by somebody else which you can import byt installing that module in you program using pip***

# Types of Modules?
   *** Built-in => which you during installation of python in your system.***
   *** External => which you have to install using "pip" in your system.***

***Simple example of Python working that is you can use pyhton as "Calculater"*** 
      ***REPl - Read Evaluate Print loop***

# Comments?
 *Basiclly developer use this for give instruction in code base. Comments will never show on Browser when we run file on web-browser.*
 *Comment can be single line or Multiple line*

# Key-Features of Python 
  - Easy to understand = Fast Development
  - Free and open source
  - Work with every Opreating system.
  - Enjoy workin with it.

# World best code we gonna written
  for Javascript we use console.log("Hello World")   ==> print("Hello World") for Python Language
  - for "run" pyhton we need just click on Run button.
  - External command for terminal ```python {file.name}``` you can use shortcut just write "pyhton" space you file names first letter -> "python h" then press tab it will auto-complete name and after getting name hit "Enter" button.

# Install Python Extension
  1. Open visual studion code.
  2. Click on "Extension" tab.
  3. Search "Python" in search-bar.
  4. Click on Install button.
  5. Congratulation! You done it.
  6. Final and last step select pyhton Interprater.

# Variables and Datatypes in Python
  *Variable is name given to value for storing in your program or with Declare a varible name with value you can use that anywher in that particuler file*
  *TO declare a variable name you have to follow set of Rules:*
  1. variable name can contain alphabet,numbers,underscore.
  2. variable name can never be start with number.
  3. variable name can only start with Alphabet.
  4. you can't give space inside variable name.

  ***Datatype in python- mostly used datatype are as following:-***
  *Integerns*
  *Floating point numbers*
  *Strings*
  *Boolean*
  *None*

  # Operators in Pyhton
    1. Arithmetic operators => "+,-,/,*" common examples.
    2. Assignment operators => "=,+=,-=" you will use in further steps.
    3. Comperison operators => "==,>,>=,<,<=,!=" for compare value and type also.
    4. Logical operators => "and,or,not" check logic in functions.

# type() functions and typecasting
  - if you have number in string and you want to add number in that string, Just put variable name as parameter in ```int(varibele.name)``` then string number will be convert in number or integer. But it is valid on number or integers.

# String
  *String is just a Datatype in Python*
  *You can write with three ways*
   1. Single quoted string -> course="Pyhton"
   2. Double quoted string -> language="Hindi"
   3. Triple quoted string -> easy='''Yes'''

# String Slicing
  - slice means chop into peaces "Simple words to make every single words as string you can use "Slicing" in pyhton.   

  *what you need to know for use slicing?*
  1. Index -> this is given by pyhton internaly to string chracters.
  2. Length -> total words or chracters in string is Length of that string.
